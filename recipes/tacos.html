    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Traditional Mexican beef tacos are made with marinated sliced or shredded beef on soft corn tortillas.  Those are great!  But, thatâ€™s not what most Americans think of when we think of classic tacos.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. 90% to 93% lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
        <li>Garlic powder</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Tortillas</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the beef to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Break the meat apart with a wooden spoon. Add the chili powder, cumin, salt, oregano, garlic powder, and pepper to the meat. Stir well. Cook until the meat is cooked through, about 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the tomato sauce and water. Stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 7-8 minutes, until some of the liquid evaporates but the meat mixture is still a little saucy. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Warm the tortillas according to their package directions.</li>
        <li>Fill the taco shells with 2 heaping tablespoons of taco meat. Top with desired taco toppings: shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, diced red onion, taco sauce, sour cream, guacamole, etc.</li>
    </ol>
